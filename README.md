# shopify-tcgplayer-price-updater
Automate checking of TCGplayer prices and push updated prices with the Shopify API

### Overview
I was sick of updating our Shopify inventory manually by alt-tabbing between Shopify and TCGPlayer for items that have a direct reference to that platform.  This Python script automates that process when you provide TCGplayer's product ID as the Shopify SKU.  Run the script and watch it work.  For big price swings you'll need to manually approve or deny that change at the end of the batch.
